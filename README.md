NOTES:

To use you must first have a bot made, and also have a folder ready.
You must have Node (latest or recommended) installed.
You must have a script editor (I suggest VSC).
You must have git installed (newest version).

Open the folder through a terminal.

EXAMPLE:

cd documents

cd botfolder

Once inside the folder through a terminal, run the command: 'npm init'.
Set everything to your choice, but make the entry-point: "main.js".
Open the folder through your script editor and then open another terminal, this time through your editor (assuming you are using VSC idk about others).
Run the command: 'npm i discord.js@12.5.3' (NOTE: THE '@12.5.3' IS CRUCIAL IF YOU WANT THIS TO WORK).
Once it has installed, you can now go to 'https://github.com/GlockCat/Template/' (NOT INSIDE ANY FILE OR FOLDER) and make sure you have the link copied.
In the script editor run the command 'git clone https://github.com/GlockCat/Template/'.
This will clone my template into your folder.
FRom there, just quickly skim through the files and check for EDIT variables. These are the ones you should edit (prefix of choice for prefix, token from bot, etc.)
Delete the 'placeholder.txt's and you're ready to code! Check 'Template2.txt' for code templates and other optional things.
